# churn_rates

**SQL Project from Codecademy**

Calculating Churn Rates for business performance after four months launching Codeflix.
We have two distinct channels (segment) for subscription.
The dataset contains one SQL table, subscriptions. Within the table, there are 4 columns:

1. **id** - the subscription id
2. **subscription_start** - the start date of the subscription
3. **subscription_end** - the end date of the subscription
4. **segment** - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to

Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.
